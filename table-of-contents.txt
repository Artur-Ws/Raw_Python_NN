Table of contents, with short description of each file in project:

           <Perceptron.py> - contains a Perceptron class, that takes input list, weight list
                           and bias for particular neuron in layer. It has a <output> method,
                           which returns output of that neuron, and a <calculate_layer> function,
                           which returns a list of outputs of all given neurons in layer.
                           Kinda playground in general

<linear_algebra_basics.py> - Bunch of general information about NumPy arrays and linear algebra
                           with examples and comments, also kinda playground and personal manual

        <random_matrix.py> - File contains a function <random_matrix> for matrices generation,
                           which has each element value between given range, and certain number
                           of rows and columns
